        <h3> Tyler The Creator </h3>
        <h4>What inspires me most about this artist, is his ability to undeniably himself. </h4>
        <p>No matter what form of art he puts out, it is always so very clearly him. Something I find the most interesting is how you can tell when something
            <br> he "made" wasn't actually made by him. For example, GOLF (his clothing brand), no longer is designed by him and is clear that he doesn't design
            <br> the clothing anymore. I love an artist who's soul you can feel in their work.</p>

       <h3> Gina M. Contreras </h3>
       <h4>I discovered her around a year and a half ago at a local art gallery that she had a short residency at.</h4>
        <p>Out of all of the artists featured at the gallery, the emotions from her artwork were what stuck out the most. I admire this artist because every single
            <br> time I see her work pop up at a local show (for example a skate shop hosted one a year ago!) I am able to understand immediately the meaning and
            <br> depth of her work. Having that ability to move people is what I admire her most.</p>

       <h3> Octavia Butler </h3>
       <h4>Butler is by far my favorite author, which I do consider a form of art, ever. </h4>
 <p> I think once again, this artist and the reason why I enjoy their art comes back down to emotions. Her work is insane, reading one of her books for
    <br> the first time left me entranced. I did not put the book down once (SERIOUSLY!) until I had finished it in about ~2 hours. The work she puts out
    <br> is politically accurate and incredibly moving to read. </p>

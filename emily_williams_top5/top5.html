                </li>
                <p> When judging fries, a key point of interest for me is their size to crunch to softness ratio. A basket of fries that are skinny and crunchy are no more enjoyable than a bag of chips. Thick floppy fries, are no better than eating a semi-cooked potato. However a good size and crunch/softness factor is needed to achieve ultimate fry level.</p>
